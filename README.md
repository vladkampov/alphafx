# Test task

## To Run

## `yarn install && yarn start`

Please be sure you've defined API url with `export REACT_APP_CORE_API_DOMAIN=https://set-proper-url/api`
Note to pre-install yarn on your machine

## With Docker

```
    docker build -t alphafx --build-arg URL=https://set-proper-url/api .
    docker run -p 80:80 -d alphafx 
```

Then open [localhost](http://localhost)

## Possible TODOs:

- Testing, all the way
- Improve API â€“ current requests are with POST method (possibly switch to GraphQL)
- Handle auth if needed
- Add localisation
- Eject CRA config
